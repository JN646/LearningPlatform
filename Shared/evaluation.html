		<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
		<p>What didn't go so well during your project? Were they in your control or outside factors?</p>
		<h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>
	  <p>If you were to do this project again what would you do and what you change? Looking back at your project did anything change from planning to production? Were there any technical issues? If so how did you solve them?</p><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
