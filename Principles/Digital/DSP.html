		<h1>DSP
		(Digital Signal Processing)</h1>
		<p>Digital Signal Processors (DSP)  take real-world signals like voice, audio, video, temperature, pressure, or  position that have been digitised and then manipulate them. A DSP is designed  for performing mathematical functions like &quot;add&quot;, &quot;subtract&quot;,  &quot;multiply&quot; and &quot;divide&quot; very quickly.</p>
        <p>Signals need to be processed so  that the information can be displayed, analysed, or converted to another type  of signal. In the real-world, analogue products detect signals such as sound,  light, temperature or pressure and manipulate them. Converters such as an  Analog-to-Digital converter then take the real-world signal and turn it into 1's  and 0's so computer chips can understand them. The DSP then takes over by  capturing the digital information and processing it. It then feeds the digitised  information back for use in the real world. This is done either digitally or by  using a Digital-to-Analog converter.</p>
        <p>A DSP's information can be used  by a computer to control such things as security, telephone, home theatre  systems, and video compression. Signals may be compressed so that they can be  transmitted quickly and more efficiently from one place to another. Signals may  also be enhanced or manipulated to improve their quality or provide information  that is not sensed by humans (e.g. echo cancellation for mobile phones or  computer-enhanced medical images). Although real-world signals can be processed  in their analogue form, processing signals digitally provides the advantages of  high speed and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Because it's programmable, a DSP  can be used in a wide variety of applications.</p>
