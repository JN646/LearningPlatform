		<h1>Microphone Polar Patterns</h1>
        <p>Polar patterns describe the angle and shape that the microphone will pick up sound. Different polar patterns are suited for different applications.</p>
        <h2>Common Patterns</h2>
		<p><strong>Cardioid polar pattern:</strong> Cardioid microphones are most sensitive to sound at  the front and least sensitive at the back. Their unidirectional pickup makes  for affective isolation of unwanted ambient sound and high resistance to  feedback when compared to omnidirectional alternatives. Cardioid microphones  are essential when considering a mic for live performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Supercardioid polar pattern:</strong> Supercardioid microphones offer a narrower pickup  than cardioids and a greater rejection of ambient sound. However, they also  pick up a small amount of sound from directly behind. For this reason, it is  particularly important to place monitor speakers to the side facing the 'dead  spots'. Supercardioids are highly suited to very loud stage environments as  they are very directional with high gain before feedback.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Omnidirectional polar pattern:</strong> Omnidirectional microphones are equally sensitive to  sound arriving from all angles. Therefore, the microphone does not need to be  aimed in any direction. This can be particularly useful when using a lapel mic  to capture a speaker&rsquo;s voice, as the individual can move their head without  affecting the sound. The disadvantage is that an omni mic cannot be aimed away  from undesired sources, such as PA speakers, which may cause feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>Figure of eight polar pattern:</strong> A microphone with a figure-of-eight polar pattern  picks up the sound from in front of the microphone and from the rear but not  the sides (90-degree angle). Microphones with a figure-of-eight polar pattern  are typically ribbon or large diaphragm condenser microphones.</p>
